# Power Window Control System Using FreeRTOS

## Introduction

The Power Window Control System project utilizes the STM microcontroller and FreeRTOS to control the front passenger door window from both the passenger and driver panels. It incorporates manual and one-touch auto open/close functions, a window lock feature, and jam protection. The system includes two limit switches to prevent the window from moving beyond its upper and lower bounds and uses a push button for obstacle detection. By integrating these features, the project aims to enhance passenger safety and convenience through reliable and responsive window control.

## System Basic Features

1. **Manual Open/Close Function**:  
   The window opens or closes continuously while the power window switch is pressed or pulled.
   
2. **One-Touch Auto Open/Close Function**:  
   A short press or pull on the power window switch fully opens or closes the window.
   
3. **Window Lock Function**:  
   Activating the window lock switch disables the opening and closing of all windows except the driverâ€™s window.
   
4. **Jam Protection Function**:  
   Automatically stops and reverses the window if an obstacle is detected during the one-touch auto-close operation.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Task Management**:
   - **Lock Task**: Monitors the lock button state and adjusts the priority of the driver task accordingly.
   - **Jam Task**: Controls the motor to turn it down for a specified duration.
   - **Receive Queue**: Receives commands from lower priority tasks through a queue and controls the motor state accordingly.
   - **Driver Task**: Handles button inputs from the user, determines the operating mode (automatic or manual), and sends control signals to the motor.
   - **Passenger Task**: Similar to the driver task but for passenger buttons.

2. **Motor Control**:  
   The system controls the motor to move the window up, down, or stop based on user inputs, synchronized to prevent conflicting commands.

3. **Button Inputs**:  
   The system monitors button inputs from both the driver and passenger, debouncing to prevent false triggers. Short presses activate automatic mode, and long presses activate manual mode.

4. **Semaphore and Mutex Handling**:  
   The system utilizes semaphores and mutexes for access to shared resources such as the motor and queues, ensuring synchronization and exclusive access.

5. **Interrupt Handling**:  
   The system handles interrupts efficiently to respond to external events like button presses, prioritizing interrupts for timely response.

6. **Error Handling**:  
   The system detects and handles errors such as motor failure or sensor malfunctions, logging error conditions for debugging and troubleshooting.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:  
   The system responds to user inputs within an acceptable time frame. Task scheduling is optimized to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

2. **Reliability**:  
   The system operates reliably under normal and abnormal conditions, implementing recovery mechanisms to handle faults gracefully.

3. **Portability**:  
   The system is portable across different hardware platforms with minimal modifications, abstracting hardware-specific configurations.

4. **Maintainability**:  
   The code is well-structured and documented for ease of maintenance and future enhancements, following modular design principles.

## Task Descriptions

1. **Lock Task**
   - **Description**: Waits for a semaphore from an ISR, indicating a lock event, checks the lock button state, and adjusts the driver task priority.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Waits for a semaphore to signal a lock event.
     - Checks the lock button state.
     - Sets the driver task priority to 2 and turns on a red LED if the lock button is pressed.
     - Sets the driver task priority to 1 and turns off the red LED if the lock button is released.
   - **Priority**: HIGH (4).

2. **Jam Task**
   - **Description**: Activates the motor to turn it down for 1 second upon receiving a semaphore from an ISR.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Waits for a semaphore indicating a motor jam event.
     - Activates the motor to turn it down.
     - Delays for 1 second using a timer.
     - Stops the motor.
   - **Priority**: HIGH (5).

3. **Receive Queue Task**
   - **Description**: Waits for data from lower priority tasks through a queue and controls the motor state accordingly.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Waits for data from a queue.
     - Receives motor control commands (OFF, UP, DOWN) from other tasks.
     - Controls the motor state based on the received command.
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM (3).

4. **Driver Task**
   - **Description**: Handles button inputs from the user, determines the operating mode, and sends control signals to the motor.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Takes a mutex for exclusive access to critical sections.
     - Polls UP and DOWN buttons for user inputs.
     - Detects short presses for automatic mode and long presses for manual mode.
     - Sends motor control commands (UP, DOWN, OFF) to the queue.
   - **Priority**: LOW (1).

5. **Passenger Task**
   - **Description**: Similar to the driver task but handles passenger button inputs.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Takes a mutex for exclusive access to critical sections.
     - Polls UP and DOWN passenger buttons for inputs.
     - Detects short and long presses to determine the mode of operation.
     - Sends motor control commands to the queue.
   - **Priority**: LOW (1).

## Conclusion

The Power Window Control System is designed to provide a reliable and efficient solution for automating window operations. By adhering to the outlined requirements, the system will meet user expectations for functionality, performance, and reliability.
